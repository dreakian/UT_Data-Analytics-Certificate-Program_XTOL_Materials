"""
Before running, make sure you set the scripts folder and output
folder paths below.
Your Mapper.py and Reducer.py should both be within the scripts
folder of your s3 account and must be named 'Mapper.py' and 
'Reducer.py' (case sensitive).
The output folder is where the map/reduce resultant files will
be placed.
